# pHD &mdash; Manage holograms with intelligence

### Overview
Vanilla hologram providers display holograms whenever a player is within the standard Minecraft view distance.
pHD adds capabilities to manage individual hologram visibility.
It adds fine control over hologram visibility and duration, plus permission-based restrictions.
pHD does not modify the content of the holograms themselves.

pHD manages hologram visibility based on a combination of display types and options.
Types include per-player limitation on the number of views, and activation at specific Minecraft or real-world times of day. Options include the visibility duration, acquisition distance, flashing, and permissions restrictions.
Multiple types and options may be associated with any hologram.

All pHD commands are accessible at the console, and in-game with appropriate permissions (default OP). Tab-completion is supported for all commands.
If LuckPerms (5.0 or higher) is installed, tab-completion is supported for permissions in pHD commands.

All pHD messages may be localized. Message changes take effect on plugin reload or server restart.

Supported data storage types include SQLITE (default) and YAML. Conversion between storage types is supported.

### The Wiki
pHD is completely documented on The Wiki. Please start there when you have questions.
