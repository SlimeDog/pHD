### pHD
An intelligent manager for HolographicDisplays

### Overview
pHD manages the display of holograms defined by HolographicDisplays.
It adds fine control over hologram visibility and duration, plus permission-based restrictions.
pHD does not modify the content of the holograms themselves.

pHD manages hologram visibility based on a combination of display types and options.
Types include per-player limitation on the number of views, and activation at specific Minecraft or real-world times of day. Options include the visibility duration, acquisition distance, flashing, and permissions restrictions.
Multiple types and options may be associated with any hologram.

All pHD commands are accessible at the console, and in-game with appropriate permissions (default OP). Tab-completion is supported for all commands.
If LuckPerms (5.0 or higher) is installed, tab-completion is supported for permissions in pHD commands.

All pHD messages may be localized. Message changes take effect on plugin reload or server restart.

Supported data storage types include SQLITE (default) and YAML. Conversion between storage types is supported.

### Version Support
pHD 1.0.x is certified for Spigot 1.13.2, 1.14.4, and 1.15.2; with HolographicDisplays 2.4.1 and ProtocolLib 4.5.0.

Based on _ad hoc_ usage,
HolographicDisplays 2.4.2 and ProtocolLib 4.5.1 development releases are also compatible, but they are not certified.

pHD may or may not work on previous Spigot releases or non-Spigot variants.

HolographicDisplays 2.3.2 and HolographicDisplays 2.4.0 should work with compatible Spigot releases,
but only HolographicDisplays 2.4.1 has been certified.

Note: Only certified releases are supported.
